This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Quick Start (Windows)

For new contributors on Windows there's a small setup script to make installation straightforward.

1) From PowerShell (run as Administrator if you don't have permissions):

```powershell
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

This script will install Node (via winget) if missing, enable Corepack, install pnpm, and run `pnpm install`.

2) Alternatively, you can run the one-liner using npm (provided Node is installed):

```powershell
npm run setup
```

3) Start the dev server:

```powershell
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```
